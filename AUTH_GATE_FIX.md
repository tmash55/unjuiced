# Auth Gate Manual Refresh Fix ✅

## 🐛 Problem

After signing in and being redirected to `/arbitrage`, the auth gate was still showing. Users had to manually refresh the page to see the actual content.

**Root Cause:**
- The `useEntitlements()` hook caches plan data for 5 minutes
- When a user signs in, the cache wasn't being invalidated
- Components were using stale cached data (showing "free" plan)
- Manual refresh forced a new fetch, revealing the correct plan

---

## ✅ Solution

Updated `AuthProvider` to automatically invalidate the entitlements cache when authentication state changes.

### **Changes Made:**

**File 1:** `components/auth/auth-provider.tsx`

1. **Import React Query:**
```typescript
import { useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
```

2. **Get QueryClient instance:**
```typescript
const queryClient = useQueryClient();
```

3. **Invalidate cache on auth events:**
```typescript
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Invalidate entitlements cache on sign in/out to force refetch
  if (event === 'SIGNED_IN' || event === 'SIGNED_OUT' || event === 'TOKEN_REFRESHED') {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['me-plan'] });
  }
});
```

**File 2:** `app/layout.tsx`

4. **Reorder providers** (QueryProvider must wrap AuthProvider):
```typescript
<QueryProvider>
  <AuthProvider>
    {/* ... */}
  </AuthProvider>
</QueryProvider>
```

**Why:** `AuthProvider` uses `useQueryClient()`, so it must be a child of `QueryProvider`.

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### **Before (Broken):**
```
1. User signs in
2. Redirected to /arbitrage
3. useEntitlements() returns cached "free" plan
4. Auth gate shows (incorrect)
5. User manually refreshes
6. useEntitlements() fetches fresh data
7. Auth gate hides (correct)
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
1. User signs in
2. AuthProvider detects SIGNED_IN event
3. Invalidates ['me-plan'] query cache
4. Redirected to /arbitrage
5. useEntitlements() fetches fresh data (no cache)
6. Auth gate hides immediately (correct) ✅
```

## 📊 Events Handled

The cache is invalidated on these Supabase auth events:

1. **`SIGNED_IN`** - User successfully signs in
2. **`SIGNED_OUT`** - User signs out
3. **`TOKEN_REFRESHED`** - Session token is refreshed (every hour)

This ensures the entitlements are always fresh after any auth state change.

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Case 1: Sign In**
1. Sign out (if signed in)
2. Visit `/arbitrage`
3. See auth gate
4. Click "Sign in"
5. Enter credentials
6. **Expected:** Redirected to `/arbitrage` with NO auth gate ✅

### **Test Case 2: Sign Out**
1. Sign in as Pro user
2. Visit `/arbitrage`
3. See arbitrage table
4. Sign out
5. **Expected:** Auth gate appears immediately (no manual refresh) ✅

### **Test Case 3: Token Refresh**
1. Sign in
2. Wait 1+ hour (or force token refresh)
3. **Expected:** Entitlements refetch automatically ✅

### **Test Case 4: Trial Activation**
1. Sign in as new user
2. Visit `/arbitrage`
3. Click "Start Free Trial"
4. **Expected:** Auth gate disappears immediately ✅

- ✅ `/ev` - No more "Limited EV Access" banner after upgrading
- ✅ `/odds/{sport}` - No more Pro gate modal after upgrading
- ✅ Account dropdown - Shows correct plan badge immediately
- ✅ Navbar - "Pricing" link hides/shows correctly

### **User Experience:**
- ✅ No manual refresh needed after sign in
- ✅ No manual refresh needed after sign out
- ✅ No manual refresh needed after trial activation
- ✅ No manual refresh needed after subscription purchase
- ✅ Instant UI updates on auth state changes

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **React Query Cache Invalidation:**

```typescript
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['me-plan'] });
```

**What this does:**
1. Marks the `['me-plan']` query as stale
2. If any component is currently using `useEntitlements()`, it will refetch immediately
3. Next time `useEntitlements()` is called, it will fetch fresh data

**Why it works:**
- React Query automatically refetches invalidated queries that are being actively used
- All components using `useEntitlements()` or `useIsPro()` get fresh data instantly
- No need to manually trigger refetches in individual components

## 📝 Alternative Approaches Considered

### **❌ Option 1: Reduce cache time**
```typescript
staleTime: 0, // No caching
```
**Problem:** Too many API calls, poor performance

### **❌ Option 2: Manual refetch in each component**
```typescript
const { refetch } = useEntitlements();
useEffect(() => { if (user) refetch(); }, [user]);
```
**Problem:** Repetitive, error-prone, not DRY

### **✅ Option 3: Centralized cache invalidation (chosen)**
```typescript
// In AuthProvider
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['me-plan'] });
```
**Benefits:** 
- Single source of truth
- Automatic across all components
- Maintains caching benefits
- VC-grade solution
