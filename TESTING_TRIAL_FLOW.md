# Testing Trial Flow - Quick Guide

## üß™ How to Test Trial Expiration

### Method 1: Manual Database Update (Recommended)

**1. Find your test user:**
```sql
SELECT id, email, trial_used, trial_started_at, trial_ends_at 
FROM profiles 
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@test.com';
```

**2. Set trial to expire in the past:**
```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET 
  trial_used = true,
  trial_started_at = now() - interval '8 days',
  trial_ends_at = now() - interval '1 day'
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@test.com';
```

**3. Verify the change:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.current_entitlements 
WHERE user_id = '[your-user-id]';
```
Should show `current_plan = 'free'` and `entitlement_source = 'none'`

**4. Test in the app:**
- Refresh the page
- Should see "Free" badge in account dropdown
- Should see auth gate on `/arbitrage`
- Should see "Upgrade to Pro" (no trial option)

### Method 2: Set Trial to Expire Soon (Test Countdown)

**Set trial to expire in 1 hour:**
```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET 
  trial_used = true,
  trial_started_at = now() - interval '6 days 23 hours',
  trial_ends_at = now() + interval '1 hour'
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@test.com';
```

**Set trial to expire in 1 day:**
```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET 
  trial_used = true,
  trial_started_at = now() - interval '6 days',
  trial_ends_at = now() + interval '1 day'
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@test.com';
```

## üîç Verification Queries

### Check current plan:
```sql
SELECT 
  p.email,
  ce.current_plan,
  ce.entitlement_source,
  p.trial_used,
  p.trial_ends_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN p.trial_ends_at > now() THEN 'Active'
    WHEN p.trial_ends_at <= now() THEN 'Expired'
    ELSE 'Never Started'
  END as trial_status
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN public.current_entitlements ce ON ce.user_id = p.id
WHERE p.email = 'your-test-email@test.com';
```

### Check all trial users:
```sql
SELECT 
  email,
  trial_used,
  trial_started_at,
  trial_ends_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN trial_ends_at > now() THEN 'Active Trial'
    WHEN trial_ends_at <= now() THEN 'Expired Trial'
    WHEN trial_used = false THEN 'Unused Trial'
    ELSE 'No Trial'
  END as status
FROM profiles
WHERE trial_used = true OR trial_started_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY trial_ends_at DESC;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Changes not reflecting in UI
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check React Query cache (5 min stale time)
4. Log out and log back in

### Issue: Still seeing trial badge after expiration
**Solution:**
1. Verify database change:
```sql
SELECT trial_ends_at, now(), trial_ends_at > now() as is_active 
FROM profiles 
WHERE email = 'test@test.com';
```
2. Check `current_entitlements` view:
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.current_entitlements WHERE user_id = '[user-id]';
```
3. If view is correct but UI isn't, clear React Query cache

### Issue: Can't access Pro features during trial
**Solution:**
1. Check entitlements API: Visit `/api/me/plan` in browser
2. Should show `plan: "pro"` and `entitlement_source: "trial"`
3. If not, check database dates are correct
4. Verify `trial_ends_at` is in the future
