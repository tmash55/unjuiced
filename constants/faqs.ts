    question: "What exactly does this platform do?",
    answer:
      "Our platform lets you design, deploy, and manage AI-powered agentic workflows that can combine both automated (AI) and manual steps. These workflows connect to your existing tools (like Slack, Notion, or Google Sheets) and use AI agents to complete tasks.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started with creating my first workflow?",
    answer:
      "Start by using our drag-and-drop interface to design your workflow. Connect the tools you already use, define the steps (both AI and manual), and test everything in our sandbox environment before deploying. No coding required.",
  },
  {
    question: "What tools and services can I integrate?",
    answer:
      "We support hundreds of integrations including Slack, Notion, Google Workspace, Salesforce, GitHub, Zapier, and many more. You can also connect custom APIs and databases through our flexible connector system.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure when using AI agents?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we take security seriously. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, we're SOC 2 compliant, and you maintain full control over what data your agents can access. Agents only interact with the specific tools and data you explicitly authorize.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I test workflows before they go live?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Our sandbox environment lets you preview and debug workflow logic safely before deployment. You can test different scenarios, validate agent behavior, and ensure everything works as expected without affecting your live systems.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between automated and manual steps?",
    answer:
      "Automated steps are handled entirely by AI agents (like data analysis, content generation, or API calls), while manual steps require human input or approval. You can mix both types to create workflows that leverage AI efficiency while maintaining human oversight where needed.",
  },
